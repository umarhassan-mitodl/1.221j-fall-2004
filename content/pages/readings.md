Required Reading
----------------

### Text

Sussman, Joseph. _Introduction to Transportation Systems_. Norwood, MA: Artech House Publishers, 2000. ISBN: 1580531415.

As students of transportation, we would expect you will read every word of this text at least once. How the chapters in the text are keyed to the lectures is noted below. As this text grew out of the teaching of this subject, it supports and supplements the lectures.

A second text by the instructor may also be useful:

Sussman, Joseph. _Perspectives on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)_. New York, NY: Springer, 2005. ISBN: 0387232575.

### Reader

The materials below outside of the text are considered the reader for this subject. Materials in the reader are all required reading.

### Handouts

We will regularly distribute articles and newspaper clippings in class. By doing this, we hope to keep you abreast of current and developing issues in transportation as well as encourage you to get in the habit of reading newspapers and magazines from a transportation perspective. Sometimes we will include an article not explicitly on transportation to stretch your thinking. Occasionally we will ask that you read an article in preparation for discussion in the next class and, in these cases, the material should be considered required. However, most of the time these articles are provided strictly for your information and required reading should take higher priority. In addition, from time to time an article will be distributed "just for fun". We hope that it will be clear to you which ones these are.

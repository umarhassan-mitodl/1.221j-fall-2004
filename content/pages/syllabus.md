Course Description
------------------

Transportation Systems (1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J) has two major goals:

*   To teach an understanding of the world of traveler and freight transportation: How it works and how to think about analyzing and designing transportation systems
*   To teach an appreciation of the multi-dimensionality of transportation issues, emphasizing
    
    *   Technology
    *   Systems
    *   Institutions
    
      
    and how transportation fits into a broader social/political/economic context involving  
      
    *   Environmental Issues
    *   Energy Issues
    *   Economic Development
    *   Sustainability
    *   Urban Structure
    *   Land Use
    *   Equity
    *   Etc.

The subject focuses on fundamental principles of transportation systems, introduces transportation systems components and networks, and addresses how one invests in and operates them effectively. The tie between transportation and related systems is emphasized.

We discuss operating characteristics of various modes and intermodal combinations (transportation supply) and offer a perspective on "customers" (e.g., freight shippers, travelers) of transportation services and how they make transportation decisions (transportation demand).

We introduce quantitative modeling ideas and various techniques and philosophies of modeling complex transportation enterprises. Also, conceptual "frameworks" for qualitative analysis are introduced (e.g., framework for strategic regional planning, institutional change analysis, new technology development, and deployment).

1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J strives to be an interdisciplinary systems subject in the "open" sense. We look at transportation as a CLIOS (complex, large-scale, integrated, open system) embedded within and linked to many other related societal systems, and recognize the broad impact of transportation system design and deployment decisions.

1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J is required for all first-year Master of Science in Transportation students. It would be of interest to, as well as accessible to, students in Urban Studies and Planning, Political Science, Technology and Policy, Management, and various engineering departments. It is a good subject for those who plan to take only one subject in transportation and serves as an entry point to other transportation subjects as well.

While conducted as a graduate subject, motivated undergraduates interested in transportation and a broad perspective on large-scale systems are welcome. CEE undergraduates can use 1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J as a subject in a transportation concentration, satisfying the SB requirement in Course I.

Academic Honesty Policy for 1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J
-------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering adheres to the strictest standards of academic honesty. An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty as regards academic honesty. This statement clarifies the faculty's expectations in 1.221J / 11.527J / ESD.201J. See the sections on {{% resource_link 9545726d-742a-aaa7-f80c-ccce3c609d28 "assignments" %}} and {{% resource_link abc3f042-44c1-9bf1-7275-49bf5c5e43a2 "exams" %}} for further expectations germane to this course.

If you have any questions about how these policies relate to a specific situation, you should speak to the Professor or TA for clarification.
